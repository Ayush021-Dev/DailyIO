# Font Families for DailyIO

**Font families that align with DAILYIO's goals of being a daily destination for news, weather, games, and productivity while maintaining readability and reducing eye strain.**

## Primary Font Selection - Poppins

For our main font family, I recommend Poppins. This choice is strategic for several reasons:
1. **The font's geometric structure provides excellent readability for daily use**
2. **It offers a comprehensive range of weights, allowing proper visual hierarchy**
3. **Its modern, friendly character aligns with our platform's approachable nature**
4. **The font maintains clarity at various sizes, crucial for displaying different types of content**

## Secondary Font Selection - Inter

To complement Poppins, I recommend Inter as our secondary font. This pairing works exceptionally well because:
1. **Inter excels in readability for longer text blocks**
2. **It was specifically designed for computer screens**
3. **Its neutral character works harmoniously with Poppins**
4. **The font performs well across different screen sizes and resolutions**

## Implementation Strategy

### For Headers and Navigation:
- **Use Poppins Semi-Bold (600) for main headers**
- **Apply Poppins Medium (500) for sub-headers**
- **Maintain Poppins Regular (400) for navigation items**

### For Body Content:
- **Use Inter Regular (400) for main content text**
- **Apply Inter Medium (500) for emphasis within paragraphs**
- **Keep Inter Light (300) for secondary information**

### For Interactive Elements:
- **Implement Poppins Medium (500) for buttons**
- **Use Poppins Regular (400) for form labels**
- **Apply Inter Regular (400) for form inputs**

### Font Size Hierarchy:
- **Main Headers: 32px/2rem (Poppins)**
- **Sub-headers: 24px/1.5rem (Poppins)**
- **Navigation: 16px/1rem (Poppins)**
- **Body Text: 16px/1rem (Inter)**
- **Secondary Text: 14px/0.875rem (Inter)**

## Key Project Goals
These font selections support our key project goals by:
1. **Ensuring comfortable extended reading sessions**
2. **Maintaining professional appearance while being approachable**
3. **Supporting clear information hierarchy**
4. **Providing optimal legibility across various screen sizes**
5. **Reducing eye strain during prolonged use**

### Implementation Note:
**These fonts are available through Google Fonts, making them easily accessible and ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms. For optimal performance, we should implement font subsetting to load only the required character sets and weights.**
